# NixOS

NixOS Configurations using flake and home manager (and other dotfiles as submodules)

## Powered by

* Bat
* Dunst
* Fuzzel
* Hyprland
* Kitty
* LSD
* NeoVim
* Waybar

> Unstable repos enabled

All of the configurations are here as submodules to make it more portable and managable

## Special Aliases

* `update` is used to apply config update and new package changes
* `upgrade` will do the same as `update` but also upgrades system and existing packages
